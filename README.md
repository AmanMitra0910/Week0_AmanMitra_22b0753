# Question 1
# Part 1

Step 1 : Declare the required  numbers and the answers or the parts of the answer<br />
Step 2 : Give a command to calculate  the exponential part as exp  and the substraction part as sub , and then use them to get the result.<br />
Step 3 : print the result statement.<br />
Step 4 : finally , end the program.<br />

# Part 2

Step 1 : Declare the required  numbers and the answers or the parts of the answer<br />
Step 2 : Give a command to calculate  the exponential part as m and the multiplication part as s<br />
Step 3 : Use intrinsic log and abs and cosd(degrees as input), and then use them to get the result.<br />
Step 4 : print the result statement.<br />
Step 5 : finally , end the program.<br />

# Part 3

Step 1 : Declare the required numbers , constants and the answers or the parts of the answer<br />
Step 2 : Directly use the instrinsic function of sqrt() and formulate the result<br />
Step 3 : Print the result statement.<br />
Step 4 : Finally , end the program.<br />

# Question 2

Step 1 : Declare an array of inputs and some more required numbers.<br />
Step 2 : Now give values to the input array.<br />
Step 3 : use a do loop, in which make an if-block such that we can use the function.<br />
Step 4 : Before closing the loop print the result statement , such that we can get a result of each the inputs from the input array.<br />
Step 5 : End the do loop , and end the program.<br />

# Question 3

Step 1 : Declare required variables and numbers and temporary results of the factorials.<br />
Step 2 : Write an input statement using read().<br />
Step 3 : Firstly , for a factorial, use an if-block , to make an exclusive case for zero  and for the else case we solve using a do-while loop , in which we multiply the number by its consecutive descending order till it decreases to 1, and then print out a solution statement.<br />
Step 4 : Secondly , for a double factorial, use an if block for even numbers , and in an else block , using a do-while loop, in which we multiply the odd number by it's consecutive descending-by-2 order till it decreases to 1, and then print out the solution statement, ending the if block.<br />
Step 5 : End the program.

# Question 4

# Part 1

Step 1 : Declare the variables required.<br />
Step 2 : Get the desired inputs from the user.<br />
Step 3 : Use a soon to be defined function  to get the sum required. Print the sum and also print the statement proving the value of pi.<br / >
Step 4 : Use 'contains' to include the function of the summation.<br />
Step 5 : Call the required variables for the function, then use a do loop to get the summation required. then finally define the function as the summation from the do loop.<br />
Step 6 : Then close the function and finally close the program.<br />

# Part 2

Step 1 : Declare the variables required.<br />
Step 2 : Get the desired inputs from the user.<br />
Step 3 : Use a soon to be defined function  to get the sum required. Print the sum and also print the statement proving the value of e^x and give multiple proofs for a variable type function.<br />
Step 4 : Use 'contains' to include the function of the summation and another important function i.e, factorial.<br />
Step 5 : Call the required variables for the function, then use a do loop to get the summation required. then finally define the function as the summation from the do loop.<br />
Step 6 : Call another function similar to the  factorial , using conditional statement and do loop<.br />
Step 7 : Then close the functions and finally close the program.<br />
