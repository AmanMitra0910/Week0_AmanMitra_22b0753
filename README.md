# Question 1
# Part 1

Step 1 : Declare the required  numbers and the answers or the parts of the answer
Step 2 : Give a command to calculate  the exponential part as exp  and the substraction part as sub , and then use them to get the result.
Step 3 : print the result statement.
Step 4 : finally , end the program.

# Part 2

Step 1 : Declare the required  numbers and the answers or the parts of the answer
Step 2 : Give a command to calculate  the exponential part as m and the multiplication part as s  
Step 3 : Use intrinsic log and abs and cosd(degrees as input), and then use them to get the result.
Step 4 : print the result statement.
Step 5 : finally , end the program.

# Part 3

Step 1 : Declare the required numbers , constants and the answers or the parts of the answer
Step 2 : Directly use the instrinsic function of sqrt() and formulate the result
Step 3 : Print the result statement.
Step 4 : Finally , end the program.

# Question 2

Step 1 : Declare an array of inputs and some more required numbers.
Step 2 : Now give values to the input array.
Step 3 : use a do loop, in which make an if-block such that we can use the function.
Step 4 : Before closing the loop print the result statement , such that we can get a result of each the inputs from the input array.
Step 5 : End the do loop , and end the program.

# Question 3

Step 1 : Declare required variables and numbers and temporary results of the factorials.
Step 2 : Write an input statement using read().
Step 3 : Firstly , for a factorial, use an if-block
